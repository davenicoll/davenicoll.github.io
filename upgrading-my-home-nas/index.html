        <p>I've been running various NAS devices for over a decade now. I started doing this because I always had PCs lying around, whether it was my last-gen desktop PC, or some old system I'd acquired from work. I think NAS's in the home are underrated, as they're so helpful for various projects. Whether it's providing fast access to family videos for editing, storing your favourite TV &amp; movies to stream to devices, or just needing somewhere safe for all your backups.</p><p>When I moved from the UK to Canada in 2021, I downsized from several Dell PowerEdge 720s, uploaded my data to GSuite Business (thanks to Google ignoring storage capacity limits for several years), and took a single 16TB disk with me on my travels. When I arrived in Canada, I wanted a low-maintenance NAS, with the ability to run containers, stream and transcode media, and was small enough to be moved easily. Having used Synology products before, I bought a <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/review/synology-diskstation-ds720-review?ref=localhost">Synology DiskStation DS720+</a>, added a second 16TB NAS disk, increased the memory with an 8GB RAM module, and installed 2xM.2 drives for caching.</p><p>While Synology hardware may not be anything extraordinary, their software is top-notch. OpenMediaVault, EasyNAS, FreeNAS/TrueNAS, Proxmox, Unraid, Windows(!) - I've operated them all, and nobody in the homelab/prosumer market comes close to the simplicity, capability, or app ecosystem that Synology has created with <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-ca/dsm?ref=localhost">DiskStation Manager</a> (DSM). If you're reading this guide, and you're interested in a NAS, but building one looks like too much effort, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-ca/products?product_line=ds_plus&ref=localhost">go buy a Synology</a>.</p><p>Life was good! Until the day Google emailed and informed me they were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/13kr75h/google_enforcing_storage_limit_on_old_gsuite/?ref=localhost">starting to enforce storage capacity limits in my GSuite account</a>. I had 30 days to meet the paltry limit or pay a hefty monthly cost. So, after doing some math[s], I figured, "why not buy a new NAS, increase my local storage capacity, and reduce my cloud spend".</p><h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3><p>Build vs Buy is always a factor when choosing technology, and I was leaning towards another, larger Synology. Apart from the lack of bays, the biggest disappointment of the DS720+ was the 2x 1GbE ports. My inner nerd was calling, I could build something better, faster, cheaper, so I made a list of my requirements:</p><ul><li>Small form factor</li><li>Passively-cooled CPU, or very quiet fans for near-silent operation</li><li>Capacity for 5 drives</li><li>Enough CPU/GPU for media transcoding</li><li>Power efficient</li></ul><h3 id="motherboard-and-cpu">Motherboard and CPU</h3><p>I first heard about the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004878607032.html?ref=localhost">Topton N5105 "NAS" motherboard</a> on Reddit. The reviews were generally positive, and the specs looked to be a great fit for my requirements. Searching for "N5105 NAS motherboard" on Aliexpress results in several variations. I eventually bought the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005239181127.html?ref=localhost">BKHD version</a>, with these specs:</p><ul><li>Integrated <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/212328/intel-celeron-processor-n5105-4m-cache-up-to-2-90-ghz/specifications.html?ref=localhost">Intel Celeron N5105</a> (Jasper Lake) CPU 2Ghz TDP 10W</li><li>1x M.2 NVMe (PCIe 3.0 x1) 2280</li><li>6x SATA 3.0 ports</li><li>4x Intel i226-V 2.5Gbps network interfaces</li><li>2x SO-DIMM DDR4 (2933Mhz) slots, 64GB max</li><li>1x PCI-E slot</li><li>HDMI and Display Port</li><li>Onboard sound</li><li>Mini-ITX form factor</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image.png 600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image.png 1000w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/image.png 1600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/08/image.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>BKHD N5105 motherboard</figcaption></figure><p>The board is PERFECT for my needs, especially as the Celeron N5105 has an Intel UHD i915 GPU with video encoding/decoding built-in. For the price (CAD$189/US$140/GBP£110), the board is excellent value too. (I did consider the Celeron J6412, but its newer chipset is less well-supported and, in several ways, a weaker version of the N5105). Shipping took a month thanks to a delay at customs, but BKHD customer support was helpful and responsive.</p><h3 id="case-and-power-supply">Case and power supply</h3><p>Good NAS cases can be hard to come by, and I'm not sure if it was due to the pandemic, but I had a tough time finding one at the right price point. But, I did! A coworker recommended a <a href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/N1.html?ref=localhost">Jonsbo N1</a>, and while it looked great from the outside, it was a mess internally and he admitted that putting all together had been a delicate affair. Then I noticed the <a href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/N2Black.html?ref=localhost">Jonsbo N2</a> on their website. ITX form factor? Check! 5+1 bays? Check! Priced sensibly? Check!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="800" srcset="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Jonsbo N2 case</figcaption></figure><p>I paired the Jonsbo N2 with a <a href="https://www.corsair.com/ca/en/p/psu/cp-9020186-na/sf-series-sf750-750-watt-80-plus-platinum-certified-high-performance-sfx-psu-cp-9020186-na?ref=localhost">Corsair SF750</a> modular PSU which fits snuggly and has all the necessary connections. While the case has a front-panel with cables for USB-C and audio, the motherboard doesn't have the corresponding headers, so I zip-tied the cables out of the way. Right-angle connectors on the SATA cables were essential, as it's a tight fit between the drive backplane and the rear fan. Speaking of the rear fan (a generic 120x15 fan), it was louder than I could tolerate - so I replaced it with the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x15-pwm?ref=localhost">Noctua equivalent</a>, and now I can barely hear it all.</p><h3 id="ram">RAM</h3><p>The N5105 motherboard has two DDR4 SO-DIMM slots, which I maxed out with <a href="https://www.crucial.com/memory/ddr4/ct2k32g4sfd832a?ref=localhost">64GB non-ECC 3200Mhz RAM from Crucial</a>. Yes, it's non-ECC, not ideal, but I have other mitigations to avoid data corruption.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1024" height="537" srcset="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Crucial 64GB 3200Mhz DDR4 SO-DIMM memory modules</figcaption></figure><h3 id="storage">Storage</h3><p>There's two types of storage in my NAS; the boot drive and data storage drives. I installed a 1TB NVMe drive as my boot drive, partitioned into a 64GB boot partition with TrueNAS SCALE installed, and the remaining space for apps, swap, etc. 1TB was probably overkill, but I had one spare from a previous project.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/ironwolfpro.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1364" srcset="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/ironwolfpro.png 600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/ironwolfpro.png 1000w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/ironwolfpro.png 1600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/ironwolfpro.png 2200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>IronWolf Pro 16TB HDD</figcaption></figure><p>I already had 3x <a href="https://www.seagate.com/www-content/datasheets/pdfs/ironwolf-pro-16tb-DS1914-10-1905US-en_US.pdf?ref=localhost">IronWolf Pro 16TB HDDs</a> for data storage, so I configured two to be mirrored (the data I care about) and one as a standalone stripe (for the data I don't). Would I recommend the IronWolf Pro disks? <a href="https://realhardwarereviews.com/seagate-ironwolf-pro-16tb-review/?ref=localhost">Absolutely</a>. They're performant and reliable, have a great warranty backed by a data recovery option, and are priced reasonably now that we're past the worst of Covid. <a href="https://diskprices.com/?ref=localhost">There are cheaper options out there</a> if you wanted to shop around.</p><h3 id="truenas-scale">TrueNAS SCALE</h3><p>My biggest concern was moving away from Synology DSM. Having previously run <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/?ref=localhost">TrueNAS Core</a> (FreeNAS), I know it's a solid NAS OS, but it's no DSM. I was also never that fond of FreeBSD and jails in TrueNAS Core. My interest was immediately piqued when I heard about <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/?ref=localhost">TrueNAS SCALE</a>, a new offering based on Debian with K3s (or Docker, if you prefer). </p><p>In my opinion, TrueNAS SCALE is a great option, and while there's certainly a learning curve the first time around, once running, it's pretty close to DSM in terms of ease of use.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1000" height="452" srcset="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-9.png 600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-9.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TrueNAS SCALE dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/truenas/comments/lgf75w/scalehowto_split_ssd_during_installation/?ref=localhost">partitioned the NVMe boot drive</a>, installed TrueNAS SCALE, setup my disk pools, vdevs, and sharing services. When I installed Plex though, I discovered something concerning. Despite configuring the Plex container with my PlexPass and enabling GPU support, playback of transcoded videos maxed out the CPU. Googling around, I discovered that the Linux kernel version in TrueNAS SCALE doesn't support the i915 GPU. Thankfully, Intel has backported the driver, <a href="https://gist.github.com/davenicoll/d54f155d0d0e8af427d7763cc5c425c9?ref=localhost">so I cloned the repo, built it and installed it</a>. A reboot later, and the GPU was handling transcoding with ease.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-10.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1024" height="566" srcset="https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-10.png 600w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-10.png 1000w, https://davenicoll.com/content/images/2023/08/image-10.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TrueNAS SCALE apps</figcaption></figure><h3 id="costs">Costs</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="what-do-i-think-of-the-nas">What do I think of the NAS?</h3><p>It's exactly what I set out to build; a power-efficient, fast, easy-to-use NAS with plenty of options to expand storage. </p><p>The case has been a joy to work with, and I'd use it again for a different mini build (with a quieter fan, of course). It saturates my home network, and I love working with it for video editing. With an embedded CPU on the motherboard, I won't be upgrading it, but that's not an issue for me. I expect I'll get at least 3-4 years of use from this NAS, maybe longer, who knows.</p><p>Lastly, this build was not expensive. A Synology 4-bay DS920+ without any disks retails for CAD$1,399! </p>
