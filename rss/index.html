Finally he posts some<strong><em> Code</em></strong> snippets to show his work, helping the reader to understand exactly what&#x2019;s being run. </p><p>Not only does this help me, to help Scott better, it&#x2019;s more searchable in Slack for others if they run into similar problems. </p><p>So the next time you need help, please, be more Scott Houglum.</p><hr><p>Here&apos;s an example:</p><blockquote>Hey Dave, I&apos;m wanting to add cors_rules to a storage account. &#xA0;I am assuming since we&apos;ll have different amounts of rules per storage account depending on environment that a dynamic block is best here...</blockquote><p>main.tf</p><pre><code class="language-hcl">blob_properties {
